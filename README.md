GettingAndCleaningDataProject
=============================

### Course Project for Coursera's Getting And Cleaning Data course.
This project has a single .R file, run_analysis.R, which should be in the same working directory as the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder.

Running this file will result in the output "GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProjectTidyDataSet.txt" which is the tidy dataset.

Please refer to the Codebook for description of the steps taken to clean the data. The Codebook also contains the variables of the tidy dataset.
